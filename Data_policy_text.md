# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 10 2026

**Lokin** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application (the "App") collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by the terms described herein.

## 1. Information We Collect

## 1.1 Device Activity and App Usage Data

Our App utilizes Apple’s **Screen Time API** to monitor app usage activity on your device during focus sessions. This technology allows the App to:

- Track the duration of active usage within the App.
- Detect when the App is moved to the background or when other applications are used ("break events").
- Calculate focus scores based on usage patterns.

**Important:** Screen Time API data is processed entirely on your device using privacy-preserving opaque tokens. We do not have access to specific app names, websites visited, or detailed usage logs. This data is never transmitted to our servers.

## 1.2 Locally Stored Session Data

The App stores the following data locally on your device:

- Session start and end timestamps.
- Duration of focus sessions and break intervals.
- Calculated focus scores and performance metrics.
- Usage history, streaks, and personal records.

This data is stored using secure local storage mechanisms (e.g., CoreData) and is not accessible by us or third parties.

---

## 2. Use of Information

We use the information collected solely for the purpose of providing the App’s core functionality:

- **Session Analysis:** To calculate real-time focus scores and generate session reports.
- **Performance Tracking:** To display historical data, trends, streaks, and averages within the App.
- **User Experience:** To provide feedback on focus habits and productivity patterns.

All processing of usage data occurs locally on your device. We do not use this information for advertising, marketing, or user profiling.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

## 3.1 Local Storage

All data generated or processed by the App resides exclusively on your device. We do not operate servers that collect, store, or process your personal data or usage history.

## 3.2 Data Retention

Because data is stored locally, it is retained on your device until you manually delete it or uninstall the App. If you delete the App, all associated data will be permanently removed from your device. We do not maintain backups of user data.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App does not utilize third-party analytics, tracking services, advertising networks, or cloud storage providers. No user data is shared with external entities.

Future versions of the App may include optional social features (e.g., study groups, leaderboards). If introduced, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly, and any data collection will require your explicit consent.

---

## 5. Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information. All local data is stored within the App’s sandbox environment on iOS, utilizing standard encryption provided by the operating system.

However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security against unauthorized access to your physical device.

---

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

Since the App operates entirely locally:

- **Access and Correction:** You may view and manage your session history directly within the App.
- **Deletion:** You can delete all data by uninstalling the App or using in-app data management tools (e.g., "Clear History").
- **Permissions:** You may revoke the App’s access to the Screen Time API at any time via iOS Settings > Screen Time > Family Controls. Revoking this permission will limit the App’s functionality.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Because the App does not collect data remotely, there is no risk of us transmitting or storing children's personal information.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the App following any changes indicates your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
