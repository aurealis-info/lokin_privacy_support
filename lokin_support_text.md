## Frequently Asked Questions

## How is my focus score calculated?

Your focus score (0-100) is based on how long you stay in the Lokin app during a session. Your score increases when you remain in the app and decreases when you leave to use other apps. The longer and more consistently you stay focused, the higher your score.

## Does locking my phone affect my score?

No! Locking your phone while Lokin is active does **NOT** penalize your score. Your session timer continues running and your score keeps increasing. We only track when you leave the app to use other apps while your phone is unlocked.

## How do I delete my data?

All your session data is stored locally on your device. To delete your data:

1. Go to **Settings** within the app
2. Tap **"Clear All Data"** or **"Delete History"**
3. Confirm your choice

Alternatively, deleting the Lokin app from your device will permanently remove all associated data.

## What permissions does Lokin need?

Lokin requires:

- **Screen Time API Access:** To monitor when you're using the app vs when you leave it during sessions
- **Notifications** (optional): To remind you about streaks or session goals

We do **NOT** require access to your contacts, camera, location, or any other sensitive data. All tracking happens locally on your device.

## My session ended unexpectedly. What happened?

If your session ended unexpectedly, this could happen if:

- iOS closed the app due to low memory
- Your device ran out of battery
- You force-quit the app

When you reopen Lokin, you'll be asked if you want to resume or discard the interrupted session. If you resume, the time spent away will be counted as a break.

## Is my data private and secure?

Absolutely. All your data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties. We do not collect, sell, or share your personal information. For full details, please see our Privacy Policy.
